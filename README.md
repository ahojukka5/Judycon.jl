# Judycon.jl

Package implements dynamic connectivity algorithms for Julia programming
language. In computing and graph theory, a [dynamic connectivity structure][1]
is a data structure that dynamically maintains information about the connected
components of a graph.

Dynamic connectivity has a lot of applications. For example, dynamic connetivity
[can be used][2] to determine functional connectivity change points in fMRI
data.
